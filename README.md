# 🌿 Blockchain Ledger for Industrial Carbon Capture and Trading

Welcome to an innovative blockchain solution for tracking, verifying, and trading industrial carbon capture and storage (CCS) credits! Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, this project ensures transparent, immutable tracking of carbon sequestration, issues verifiable credits, and facilitates cross-border trading with environmental impact incentives. It tackles real-world challenges like climate change, regulatory compliance, and fraud prevention in carbon markets while promoting sustainable practices through tokenized rewards.

## ✨ Features

🌱 Register and verify carbon capture from industrial facilities  
🔒 Immutable proof of carbon storage with timestamped records  
💎 Mint tokenized carbon credits (fungible tokens) for verified sequestration  
🌍 Enable cross-border trading of credits with compliance validation  
📊 Transparent audit trails for regulators and stakeholders  
📡 IoT sensor integration via oracles for real-time capture data  
🚫 Prevent double-counting with unique capture IDs  
🏆 Reward high-performing facilities with bonus tokens for eco-friendly practices  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a modular, secure, and scalable system for carbon capture and credit trading. Each contract focuses on a specific function to streamline the process. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **CarbonCaptureRegistry.clar**: Registers industrial facilities and logs capture events with hashed sensor data for proof of capture.  
2. **StorageVerification.clar**: Validates carbon storage (e.g., geological sequestration) with immutable timestamps and proof hashes.  
3. **CreditMinter.clar**: Issues fungible carbon credits as STX-based tokens based on verified capture amounts.  
4. **ComplianceChecker.clar**: Ensures credits and trades comply with regional regulations (e.g., EU ETS, California Cap-and-Trade).  
5. **TradeGateway.clar**: Facilitates cross-border credit transfers, handling conversions and jurisdictional rules.  
6. **AuditLogger.clar**: Records all actions (capture, verification, minting, trading) for regulatory transparency.  
7. **OracleIntegrator.clar**: Connects to off-chain oracles to fetch real-time data from carbon capture sensors.  
8. **EcoRewarder.clar**: Distributes bonus tokens to facilities exceeding capture or sustainability targets, incentivizing green innovation.  

**For Industrial Operators (Carbon Capturers)**

- Collect CO2 capture data from industrial systems (e.g., tons captured via IoT sensors).  
- Generate a SHA-256 hash of the data as proof.  
- Call `register-capture` in CarbonCaptureRegistry with: hash, facility ID, capture amount, and timestamp.  
- Submit storage proof to StorageVerification for validation.  
- Use CreditMinter to mint credits for verified captures.  
- Optionally earn bonus tokens via EcoRewarder for surpassing eco-targets.  

Your carbon capture is now securely recorded and monetizable!  

**For Credit Traders and Buyers**

- Query `get-credit-details` in CreditMinter to view credit details and their verified origins.  
- Use TradeGateway to initiate cross-border or local credit transfers, specifying recipient and compliance details.  
- ComplianceChecker ensures regulatory adherence during trades.  

Seamless, transparent trading with global reach!  

**For Regulators and Auditors**

- Access AuditLogger for a complete, immutable record of all actions.  
- Use `verify-capture` in StorageVerification to confirm any capture or storage claim.  
- Review EcoRewarder logs to ensure fair bonus distribution.  

Transparent auditing eliminates fraud and builds trust.  

## 🚀 Getting Started

Deploy the contracts on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. Begin with CarbonCaptureRegistry as the core entry point. For testing, simulate sensor data with mock oracles. This system drives decarbonization by ensuring verifiable carbon credits, enabling global trading, and rewarding sustainable practices, addressing issues like trust, fraud, and market fragmentation. Let’s capture carbon and reward a greener planet!
